# my_app

This app does: Rails api
* SQL-based schema management so you can use any feature of Postgres you like
* Does Not Business Logic in Active Records. Use A simple base ApplicationService and a service class generator bin/rails g service MyThing to encourage putting code in app/services
* All datetime fields in migrations uses timestamp with time zone which is the proper type in Postgres.
* A method confidence_check to allow validating assumptions in tests separate from asserting code behavior.
* A method not_implemented! to allow skipping a test you have not implemented
* No stylesheets or helpers generated by generators since they provide a false sense of modularity that is of zero benefit.
* A test to lint all your factories

$ docker-compose run runner chmod +x ./bin/setup
$ docker-compose run runner ./bin/setup
```
It builds the Docker image, installs Ruby , creates database, run migrations and seeds.
You're all set! Now you're ready to code!

$ docker-compose up sidekiq
